  Praised as “radiant” by the Boston Globe, <b>Angela Yam</b> is renowned for her impeccable musicianship and fierce stage presence. Her Boston Lyric Opera debut as Ismene in Mozart’s <span style=font-style:italic>Mitridate</span> was hailed “a sweetly poisonous, scene-stealing schemer with a sultry sparkle in her voice,” and awarded the 2024 Best Breakout Performance in a Supporting Role by the Boston Globe. Her debut with Boston Baroque as Diana in Gluck’s <span style=font-style:italic>Iphigénie en Tauride</span> was similarly praised for her “gleaming clarity” and “fitting rococo brilliance.”

<h1>
  <br> Compositional Artistic Statement
</h1>


<p>
As a performer and composer, I am inspired by the ways that each art form requires both attention to the history and traditions of a given medium, as well as individual artistic expression in putting a piece together. As a performer, I interpret the music and intention that a composer has scribed into a score; as a composer, I trust the performer(s) to expand upon the intention of a prescribed score. This collaborative process provides a ripe, fertile ground for artistic connection across mediums and between individual artists, in a process that I find builds collaborative connective tissue, fosters artistic community, and expands my understanding of humanity. Because of this, I am most drawn to themes of connection (family, feminist and LGBTQIA+ stories, liberation through self-expression, etc.) and the ways in which that connection is disrupted (generational and cultural differences, climate change, death, loss, etc.). As a composer, I take care in choosing my themes and collaborations to find projects that speak to me as an individual, in which I can expand a narrative of progress and individual/societal healing.

Hailed as “radiant” by the Boston Globe, <b>Angela Yam</b> has sung with the New York City Ballet, Santa Fe Opera, Boston Baroque, Chautauqua Opera, and Opera Saratoga. This season, Yam joins Boston Lyric Opera as an Emerging Artist, and makes her company debuts with Opera Parallèle, Guerilla Opera, and Cambridge Chamber Ensemble. Praised for her work in new music, her portrayal of the Bird in Jones’ and Tinley’s <span style=font-style:italic>ICELAND</span> was described as “stellar…a Puccini-esque soprano with incredible highs.” Yam was a New York City District Winner in the 2023 Metropolitan Opera Laffont Competition, and her self-directed Visual Recital was awarded 3rd place in the 2022 American Prize Competition. She composed for and directed Nightingale Vocal Ensemble’s award-winning choral opera <span style=font-style:italic>ADRIFT</span> (2023), and has sung with Music at Co-Cath and Ekmeles Vocal Ensemble.

</p>


<p>
Baritone Nathan Halbur and pianist Leona Cheung perform the live premiere of Angela Yam’s composition, “From the Taiwan Cypress in Alishan” at the annual Sparks & Wiry Cries <span style=font-style:italic>song</span>SLAM.
</p>

<p>
“Fashioned after traditional poetry slams and storytelling events like <span style=font-style:italic>The Moth</span>, each SWC’s <span style=font-style:italic>song</span>SLAM gives teams of composers and performers a chance to present world premieres of art song and compete for audience-awarded cash prizes totaling up to $2,000. Each regional <span style=font-style:italic>song</span>SLAM is produced with a partnering local organization.  Since the inaugural <span style=font-style:italic>song</span>SLAM of 2016 in NYC, our first come, first served registration has filled in under 15 minutes of opening, and our <span style=font-style:italic>song</span>SLAM audiences are typically sold out and/or standing room only.   The <span style=font-style:italic>song</span>SLAM was developed to bring in new, energized, and invested audiences for art song while removing barriers and gatekeepers for performers and composers. Our NYC <span style=font-style:italic>song</span>SLAM is the flagship event and in 2024 will be produced in partnership with National Sawdust.”

<b>January 26, 2024 | The Brattle Theatre, Cambridge, MA</b>
</p>


<p>
Angela Yam joins Nightingale Vocal Ensemble in a freely improvised <span style=font-style:italic>a cappella</span> concert, PHOTOPLAY.
</p>

<p>
“On their 2023 debut album <span style=font-style:italic>Composition Sped Up</span>, Nightingale Vocal Ensemble explored the experimental frontier of vocal ensemble music through <span style=font-style:italic>a cappella</span> free improvisation. Nightingale now continues that exploration in PHOTOPLAY. A group of 9 singers will create fully-improvised soundtracks to a curated collection of silent films, as well as the winners of Nightingale's 2024 Short Film Contest. The films range in style from avant-garde animation to absurd comedy, and Nightingale singers will provide atmosphere, commentary, and playful interaction, taking inspiration from the visuals in real time to spontaneously generate visceral soundscapes.”

<b>February 16-18, 2024 | The Huntington Theatre, Boston, MA</b>
</p>


<p>
Angela Yam joins the Boston Lyric Opera Chorus in Bologne’s <span style=font-style:italic>The Anonymous Lover</span>.
</p>

<p>
“Celebrate your valentine with this frothy romp, filled with beautiful arias, winning characters, and charming music that inspires us to root for true love. Written in 1780 by Black virtuoso Joseph Bologne, Chevalier de Saint-Georges, <span style=font-style:italic>The Anonymous Lover</span> tells the story of Léontine, a wealthy young widow who is disenchanted with the notion of love until she begins receiving letters from an anonymous admirer. Léontine’s journey culminates in her own happy ending, a worthy romantic comedy for the ages.”

<b>March 1, 3, 6, 8, 10, 2024 | The Huntington Theatre, Boston, MA</b>
</p>


<p>
Angela Yam studies the title role of Aucoin’s <span style=font-style:italic>Eurydice</span>.
</p>

<p>
“Eurydice dies too young on her wedding day, and the opera <span style=font-style:italic>Eurydice</span> follows her journey into the underworld, which pulls her into new depths of forgetfulness, despair, and unfathomable loss. In this new retelling of Orpheus and Eurydice’s myth, based on the play by Sarah Ruhl, explore the powerful ties of family and love, parents and children, husband and wife. A disarming and intimate new arrangement conducted by composer Matthew Aucoin, <span style=font-style:italic>Eurydice</span> is a resonant story of love’s beauty and brutality – and the power of music to find us in the dark.”

<b>March 22, 23 2024 | Playhouse on the Square, Memphis, TN</b>
</p>


<p>
Angela Yam makes her house debut with Opera Memphis, performing the title role of Cavalli’s <span style=font-style:italic>La Calisto</span>.
</p>

<p>
“A jewel from the golden age of Venetian opera, this exuberant masterpiece mashes up multiple Roman myths, bending both gender and genre as it romps through eternal battles of love versus lust and responsibility versus desire.”

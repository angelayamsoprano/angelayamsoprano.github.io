In the same summer, Yam performed Johanna (Sondheim: <span style=font-style:italic>Sweeney Todd</span>), the Soprano Soloist (Rossini: <span style=font-style:italic>Petite messe solennelle</span>), and covered Elder (Lembit Beecher: <span style=font-style:italic>Sky on Swings</span>) as an Opera Saratoga Festival Artist.

Yam made her choral debuts with the New York Philharmonic (Beethoven: <span style=font-style:italic>Symphony No. 9</span>) and Music at Co-Cath (soloist, Monteverdi: <span style=font-style:italic>Vespro della Beata Vergine</span>).

<b>January 22, 2023 | The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, NY</b>
</p>

<p>
Angela Yam sings excerpts from Ellis Ludwig-Leone and Karen Russell’s <span style=font-style:italic>The Night Falls</span> as part of Works & Process at the Guggenheim.
</p>

<p>
“Works & Process at the Guggenheim presents <span style=font-style:italic>The Night Falls</span> by Karen Russell, Ellis Ludwig-Leone, and Troy Schumacher, featuring performance highlights and moderated discussion about the forthcoming premiere of <span style=font-style:italic>The Night Falls</span>. Prior to the work's world premiere, February 9-12 at PEAK Performances at Montclair State University, choreographer and director Troy Schumacher (New York City Ballet and BalletCollective), writer and lyricist Karen Russell (<span style=font-style:italic>Swamplandia!</span>), composer and lyricist Ellis Ludwig-Leone (San Fermin) discuss their creative process with moderator Michael Sean Breeden. Cast members perform highlights.”

<p>
<b>February 9, 10, 11, 12, 2023 | 1 E Normal Ave, Montclair, NJ</b>
</p>

<p>
Angela Yam premieres Ellis Ludwig-Leone and Karen Russell’s ballet opera <span style=font-style:italic>The Night Falls</span> as <b>Siren</b>, co-produced by BalletCollective, Inc. and PEAK Performances at Montclair State University.
</p>

<p>
“<span style=font-style:italic>The Night Falls</span> is a new myth for our fractured era. A recurring nightmare lures a group of eclectic strangers to an abandoned Floridian tourist trap where, fearing nightfall, they band together to resist the seduction of despair. With choreography that dramatizes the leap of empathy between bodies and music that channels the polarities of surrender and resistance, <span style=font-style:italic>The Night Falls</span> shows the visceral power of art to brace us against the abyss.”
</p>


<p>
<b>March 2, 4, 2023 | David Geffen Hall, New York, NY</b>
</p>


<p>
Angela Yam returns to the New York Philharmonic Chorus for their March to Liberation concert in David Geffen Hall.
</p>

<p>
“Still’s Symphony No. 2, <span style=font-style:italic>Song of a New Race,</span> celebrates the Black American as, in the composer’s words, 'a totally new individual.' Adolphus Hailstork’s oratorio <span style=font-style:italic>Done Made My Vow, A Ceremony,</span> conceived here for the stage by director Tazewell Thompson and video artist Rasean Davonté Johnson, honors the countless Black Americans who have faced ‘the bench of injustice, and, by doing so, changed a nation.’ A World Premiere by Courtney Bryan, with a new libretto by Thompson, celebrates a variety of Black musical heritage. Leslie B. Dunner conducts.”
</p>


<p>
<b>March 18, 19, 2023 | Boston Center for the Arts Plaza Black Box, Boston, MA</b>
</p>


<p>
Angela Yam directs a new choral opera, <span style=font-style:italic>ADRIFT</span>, with Nightingale Vocal Ensemble.
</p>

<p>
“A first-of-its-kind staged choral opera, <span style=font-style:italic>ADRIFT</span> tells a love story through the words of queer New Englander Emily Dickinson. Featuring entirely new musical settings by Nightingale resident composers, and under the direction of Angela Yam, this hour-long theatrical experience brings to life a carefully curated selection from Dickinson’s nearly 2,000 poems. The members of Nightingale Vocal Ensemble will use all of their compositional, vocal, and dramatic capabilities to celebrate—and expand—the unique capacity for an ensemble to tell a story.”

</p>

<p>
<b>March 24 to April 2, 2023 | La MaMa, New York, NY</b>
</p>

<p>
Angela Yam premieres as <b>The Bird</b> in O-Lan Jones’s <span style=font-style:italic>ICELAND</span> with Overtone Industries.
</p>

<p>
“Created by O-Lan Jones and Emmett Tinley, <span style=font-style:italic>ICELAND</span> is a contemporary love story enmeshed in the mythic world of Iceland. Vala falls off the map of the known world into the Dark Night of the Soul. Mundi, who has just met her at the airport, but feels an intense connection, goes to find her in the wilderness. They are helped by the Hiddenfolk, supernatural beings in a parallel world, who wish ardently for humans to find love because when people are in love they remember there is a Hidden World and connection between the two worlds opens. The Hiddenfolk evoke the Bird, The Bull, The Giant and The Dragon as needed to help the lovers in their quest.”

<p>
<b>March 30, April 1, April 3, 2023 | Virtual Performance</b>
</p>


<p>
Angela Yam makes her company debut with White Snake Projects in <span style=font-style:italic>Fractured Mosaics</span>, a virtual opera experience.
</p>

<p>
“An operatic response to the surge in anti-Asian hate crimes, <span style=font-style:italic>Fractured Mosaics</span> also reflects WSP’s continuing commitment to the live socially distant streaming performance model it developed with such success in the early stages of the pandemic…Underlying the theme of <span style=font-style:italic>Fractured Mosaics</span> is that even the term 'Asian American' is a social and political construct, completely missing the kaleidoscope of cultures and politics of the 20 different ethnic groups that are encompassed under that umbrella, groups that are geographically spread over more than half the land mass of the Earth. The production features music by Benjamin Kono, Randall Eng, Nilo Alcala, Liliya Ugay, and Shirish Korde, who along with their writer partners – Cerise Jacobs, Monique Truong, Deepali Gupta, Sokunthary Svay and Xu Xi – create operatic scenes of Asian Americans establishing themselves in the United States.”

<b>April 27, April 28, April 30, May 4, May 6, 2023 | The Substation in Roslindale, MA</b>
</p>


<p>
Angela Yam makes her company debut with Boston Opera Collaborative in Donizetti’s <span style=font-style:italic>L’elisir d’amore</span>, singing the role of <b>Giannetta</b> and covering <b>Adina</b>.
</p>

<p>
“Love in the air - and in the glass! When Nemorino, a bashful bus boy, has his heart set on Adina, a vivacious bar owner, it’s going to take more than dogged persistence to win her over. Fortunately, a traveling liquor salesman has just the thing - a pheromone-laden brew that’s guaranteed to turn heads and hearts. But will the potion work before Adina’s is swept off her feet by a dashing soldier?”

</p>


<p>
Angela Yam makes her company debut with White Snake Projects in <span style=font-style:italic>Fractured Mosaics</span>, a virtual opera experience.
</p>

<p>
“An operatic response to the surge in anti-Asian hate crimes, <span style=font-style:italic>Fractured Mosaics</span> also reflects WSP’s continuing commitment to the live socially distant streaming performance model it developed with such success in the early stages of the pandemic…Underlying the theme of <span style=font-style:italic>Fractured Mosaics</span> is that even the term ‘Asian American’ is a social and political construct, completely missing the kaleidoscope of cultures and politics of the 20 different ethnic groups that are encompassed under that umbrella, groups that are geographically spread over more than half the land mass of the Earth. The production features music by Benjamin Kono, Randall Eng, Nilo Alcala, Liliya Ugay, and Shirish Korde, who along with their writer partners – Cerise Jacobs, Monique Truong, Deepali Gupta, Sokunthary Svay and Xu Xi – create operatic scenes of Asian Americans establishing themselves in the United States.”

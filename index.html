      Praised for her “huge, clear voice,” <b>Angela Yam</b> has sung with the New York City Ballet, Santa Fe Opera, Opera Saratoga, and Fargo-Moorhead Opera, where her work was praised as “wickedly funny and talented,” and “a powerful soprano that really gets your attention.” Yam won the New York City District in the 2023 Metropolitan Opera Eric and Dominique Laffont Competition. An enthusiastic new music singer, her performances have been praised as “stellar” and “a Puccini-esque soprano with incredible highs.”

  In Summer 2023, Yam reprises one of her favorite roles with Chautauqua Opera: Johanna in <span style=font-style:italic>Sweeney Todd</span>.
  </p>

  	<p>
  Yam’s eclectic ‘22-’23 calendar features performances in cross-disciplinary new operas, traditional operatic repertoire, and musical theater. Her company debut with Boston Baroque was hailed by the Boston Globe as “radiant”, as “Yam brought gleaming clarity” and “fitting rococo brilliance” to the role of Diana in Gluck’s <span style=font-style:italic>Iphigénie en Tauride</span> (Boston Classical Review, The Arts Fuse). Yam made her company debut with Boston Opera Collaborative, performing as Giannetta and covering Adina (Donizetti: <span style=font-style:italic>L’elisir d’amore</span>).

  An avid new music lover, Yam employed her “very impressive soprano range” (TheaterScene.net) to achieve incredible musical detail in the premiere of O-Lan Jones’ and Emmett Tinley’s genre-breaking experimental opera <span style=font-style:italic>ICELAND</span> (Overtone Industries, La Mama Experimental Theatre Club). Her portrayal of the Bird/Heaven was hailed as “stellar”, and “a Puccini-esque soprano with incredible highs” (Poison Put to Sound). Yam’s new music skills and high vocal extension were also on display as Siren 1 in the ballet opera <span style=font-style:italic>The Night Falls</span> by Ellis Ludwig-Leone and Karen Russell (BalletCollective, PEAK Performances at Montclair State University).

  Yam’s 2022 solo concert appearances featured debuts with the New York City Ballet (Mendelssohn: <span style=font-style:italic>A Midsummer Night's Dream</span>), Opera Saratoga (Rossini: <span style=font-style:italic>Petite messe solennelle</span>), and Music at Co-Cath (Monteverdi: <span style=font-style:italic>Vespro della Beata Vergine</span>). As an ensemble singer, Yam has sung with the New York Philharmonic Chorus, Ekmeles Vocal Ensemble, and Nightingale Vocal Ensemble.

  An emerging director and composer, Yam spearheaded Nightingale Vocal Ensemble’s award-winning production of <span style=font-style:italic>ADRIFT</span>, a new choral opera. Yam’s self-directed cinematic Visual Recital was awarded 3rd place in the 2022 American Prize Competition for virtual performance.

  As a 2022 Opera Saratoga Festival Artist, Yam debuted the role of Johanna in Sondheim’s <span style=font-style:italic>Sweeney Todd</span>, covered Elder in Lembit Beecher: <span style=font-style:italic>Sky on Swings</span>, was a featured soloist in Rossini’s <span style=font-style:italic>Petite messe solennelle</span>. As a 2021 Santa Fe Opera Apprentice Singer, Yam performed the role of Cobweb (Britten: <span style=font-style:italic>A Midsummer Night's Dream</span>), covered Agave (John Corigliano: <span style=font-style:italic>Lord of Cries</span>, world premiere), and sang in the chorus of Tchaikovsky’s <span style=font-style:italic>Eugene Onegin</span> and Mozart’s <span style=font-style:italic>Le nozze di Figaro</span>. Yam debuted as a "wickedly funny and talented" Clorinda (Rossini: <span style=font-style:italic>La Cenerentola</span>) with Fargo-Moorhead Opera, and also performed Bastienne (Mozart: <span style=font-style:italic>Bastien & Bastienne</span>) and Jazz Trio (Bernstein: <span style=font-style:italic>Trouble in Tahiti</span>).

  Yam made her professional debut with Opera Modesto as Mary Crawford (Dove: <span style=font-style:italic>Mansfield Park</span>), and holds a Graduate Diploma from the New England Conservatory (2021), where she performed as Blanche de la Force (Poulenc: <span style=font-style:italic>Dialogues of the Carmelites</span>), the Coloratura Soprano (Argento: <span style=font-style:italic>Postcard from Morocco</span>), Calisto (Cavalli: <span style=font-style:italic>La Calisto</span>), and the Soprano Soloist (Haydn's <span style=font-style:italic>Die Schöpfung</span>).

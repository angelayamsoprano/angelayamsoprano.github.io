      <br> Biography
    </h1>
      
    <p style="margin-left:5%; margin-right: 5%">
      Nathan Halbur is a baritone* and composer/arranger based in Boston, Massachusetts.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:5%; margin-right: 5%">
      Growing up in California, my musical endeavors were originally focused on concert percussion and jazz/pop piano. I studied Physics as an undergraduate at the University of California, Davis. While there I received voice instruction from Zoila
      Muñoz and Dr. Robin Fisher, appeared as Figaro in Mozart’s <span style=font-style:italic>Le nozze di Figaro</span>, and was Musical Director of the Davis Chamber Choir (which entailed conducting, composing, arranging, and singing).
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:5%; margin-right: 5%">
      Since then I have worked professionally as a singer in both solo and choral capacities, moving from California to Boston in 2019. As a soloist, I have performed primarily concert works on both coasts. A recent highlight was Mendelssohn’s <span
        style=font-style:italic>Die erste Walpurgisnacht</span> in NEC’s Jordan Hall with Chorus Pro Musica and the Metropolitan Chorale, described in <span style=font-style:italic>The Boston Musical Intelligencer</span> thusly:
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%"><small>
        …the dramatic highpoint came in the call and answer discourse between a Druid watchman (Nathan Halbur, a Metropolitan Chorale Artist in Residence, in a well-projected baritone) with his uproarious pagan compatriots. “These insufferable Papist
        Christians/ let’s cleverly outwit them!…Come, with prongs and pitchforks like the very devils they invented… Join us in our whirling howl!” Who could resist? </small></p>
    <p style="margin-left:5%; margin-right: 5%">
      I have also created opportunities of my own through Causeway Chamber Soloists. One recent endeavor was a recital of French <span style=font-style:italic>mélodie</span> featuring songs by Fauré, Debussy, Ravel, and Poulenc. </p>
    <p style="margin-left:5%; margin-right: 5%">
      As a choral singer, I am experienced in secular and liturgical contexts. I’ve performed section-leader duties, as with the Metropolitan Chorale and at St. Cecilia Parish (where I sing weekly); and I’ve been part of fully professional ensembles,
      as at Church of the Advent and Emmanuel Music (with which I sang Bach’s B-minor mass in 2019). In summer of 2019 I participated in the Seraphic Fire Professional Choral Institute at the Aspen Music Festival, where I appeared in concert with
      Seraphic Fire and was the bass soloist in a masterclass performance of Handel’s <span style=font-style:italic>Jephtha</span> under the direction of Scott Jarrett. </p>
    <p style="margin-left:5%; margin-right: 5%">
      I am well-versed in music production, and have the audio equipment and skills to make professional-quality recordings from home, for virtual-choir purposes or otherwise. </p>
    <br>
    <p style="margin-left:5%; margin-right: 5%">
      <small>*While I am most accurately described as a baritone, I am comfortable in much of the bass and bass-baritone repertoire. In choirs, I sing both Bass 2 and Bass 1 as needed.</small> </p>

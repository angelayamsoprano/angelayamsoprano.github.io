Hailed as “radiant” by the Boston Globe, <b>Angela Yam</b> has sung with the New York City Ballet, Santa Fe Opera, Boston Baroque, Chautauqua Opera, and Opera Saratoga. This season, Yam joins Boston Lyric Opera as an Emerging Artist, and makes her company debuts with Opera Parallèle, Guerilla Opera, and Cambridge Chamber Ensemble. Praised for her work in new music, her portrayal of the Bird in Jones’ and Tinley’s <span style=font-style:italic>ICELAND</span> was described as “stellar…a Puccini-esque soprano with incredible highs.” Yam was a New York City District Winner in the 2023 Metropolitan Opera Laffont Competition, and her self-directed Visual Recital was awarded 3rd place in the 2022 American Prize Competition. She composed for and directed Nightingale Vocal Ensemble’s award-winning choral opera <span style=font-style:italic>ADRIFT</span> (2023), and has sung with Music at Co-Cath and Ekmeles Vocal Ensemble.

<b>October 27-28, 2023 | ODC Theater, San Francisco, CA</b>
</p>


<p>
Angela Yam returns to her home state of California, making her company debut with Opera Parallèle and originating the role of <b>Mumei</b> in the world premiere of Kenji Oh & Kelley Rourke’s <span style=font-style:italic>The Emissary</span>.
</p>

<p>
“After suffering from a massive irreparable disaster, Japan cuts itself off from the world, in what could be viewed as a post-Fukushima time. Children are so weak they can barely stand or walk: the only people with any motivation are the elderly. Mumei lives with his grandfather Yoshiro, who worries about him constantly. They carry on a day-to-day routine, with all children born ancient—frail and gray-haired, yet incredibly compassionate and wise. Mumei may be enfeebled and feverish, but he is a beacon of hope, full of wit and free of self-pity and pessimism. Yoshiro concentrates on nourishing Mumei, a strangely wonderful boy who offers ‘the beauty of the time that is yet to come.’”

<b>November 8, 10, 12, 2023 | Emerson Cutler Majestic Theatre, Boston, MA</b>
</p>


<p>
Angela Yam covers the role of <b>Clorinda</b> in BLO’s production of Rossini’s <span style=font-style:italic>La Cenerentola</span>.
</p>

<p>
“When young Angelina momentarily escapes her ungrateful stepfamily to attend a royal ball in disguise, she meets Prince Ramiro, who vows to find her after she disappears into the night. Beautiful melodies, sparkling vocals, and Rossini’s energetic score weave this timeless Cinderella story, dispensing with the fairy dust for the wisdom of the human heart. Elegant and heartfelt, this opera is one where goodness triumphs, and patience is rewarded with satisfying joy.”

<b>December 8-9, 2023 | Co-Cathedral of St. Joseph, Brooklyn, NY</b>
</p>


<p>
Angela Yam returns to Music at Co-Cath for their Christmas Concert-Plus experience, A POLYCHORAL CHRISTMAS.
</p>

<p>
“St. Mark’s Cathedral in Venice saw the birth of fantastic new repertoire in the early 1600s. Multiple choirs would be positioned at different locations throughout the cathedral and involve the congregation in one of the most magnificent sounds ever created. People traveled from all across the globe to hear this larger-than-life music reverberating within the walls of St. Marks. One of those travelers was Marc Antoine Charpentier. Impressed by this fantastic sound, the young Charpentier became a pupil of the Venetian masters. Adopting their craft, he translated this tradition into the French repertoire. Our holiday concert will focus on the polychoral music of Charpentier including his <span style=font-style:italic>Mass for Four Voices</span> and <span style=font-style:italic>Te Deum</span>. We are also happy to collaborate with The Unsung Collective, directed by Tyrone Clinton, in this concert-plus performance. Through sound and light choreography, we will bring this magnificent music back to life inside the walls of our own great Brooklyn Co-Cathedral.”

<b>February 16-18, 2024 | The Huntington Theatre, Boston, MA</b>
</p>


<p>
Angela Yam joins the Boston Lyric Opera Chorus in Bologne’s <span style=font-style:italic>The Anonymous Lover</span>.
</p>

<p>
“Celebrate your valentine with this frothy romp, filled with beautiful arias, winning characters, and charming music that inspires us to root for true love. Written in 1780 by Black virtuoso Joseph Bologne, Chevalier de Saint-Georges, <span style=font-style:italic>The Anonymous Lover</span> tells the story of Léontine, a wealthy young widow who is disenchanted with the notion of love until she begins receiving letters from an anonymous admirer. Léontine’s journey culminates in her own happy ending, a worthy romantic comedy for the ages.”

<b>March 1, 3, 6, 8, 10, 2024 | The Huntington Theatre, Boston, MA</b>
</p>


<p>
Angela Yam covers the role of <b>Little Stone</b> in Aucoin’s <span style=font-style:italic>Eurydice</span>.
</p>

<p>
“Eurydice dies too young on her wedding day, and the opera <span style=font-style:italic>Eurydice</span> follows her journey into the underworld, which pulls her into new depths of forgetfulness, despair, and unfathomable loss. In this new retelling of Orpheus and Eurydice’s myth, based on the play by Sarah Ruhl, explore the powerful ties of family and love, parents and children, husband and wife. A disarming and intimate new arrangement conducted by composer Matthew Aucoin, <span style=font-style:italic>Eurydice</span> is a resonant story of love’s beauty and brutality – and the power of music to find us in the dark.”

  Praised as “radiant” by the Boston Globe, <b>Angela Yam</b> is renowned for her impeccable musicianship and fierce stage presence. Her Boston Lyric Opera debut as Ismene in Mozart’s <span style=font-style:italic>Mitridate</span> was hailed “a sweetly poisonous, scene-stealing schemer with a sultry sparkle in her voice,” and awarded the 2024 Best Breakout Performance in a Supporting Role by the Boston Globe. Her debut with Boston Baroque as Diana in Gluck’s <span style=font-style:italic>Iphigénie en Tauride</span> was similarly praised for her “gleaming clarity” and “fitting rococo brilliance.”

<h1>
  <br> Compositional Artistic Statement
</h1>


<p>
As a performer and composer, I am inspired by the ways that each art form requires both attention to the history and traditions of a given medium, as well as individual artistic expression in putting a piece together. As a performer, I interpret the music and intention that a composer has scribed into a score; as a composer, I trust the performer(s) to expand upon the intention of a prescribed score. This collaborative process provides a ripe, fertile ground for artistic connection across mediums and between individual artists, in a process that I find builds collaborative connective tissue, fosters artistic community, and expands my understanding of humanity. Because of this, I am most drawn to themes of connection (family, feminist and LGBTQIA+ stories, liberation through self-expression, etc.) and the ways in which that connection is disrupted (generational and cultural differences, climate change, death, loss, etc.). As a composer, I take care in choosing my themes and collaborations to find projects that speak to me as an individual, in which I can expand a narrative of progress and individual/societal healing.

We hope you will join the conversation during the audience Q&A.”

</p>

<p>
“Heartbeat Opera presents our 10th Annual Drag Extravaganza, a hilarious, irreverent party at the bold intersection of drag and opera! ORGY & BESS takes off from <span style=font-style:italic>Porgy and Bess</span>, but goes on to skewer the entire opera canon. What happens to Bess after Porgy? She stumbles from the 1920s into 2025 NYC, and the first person she meets is Cio-Cio-San from <span style=font-style:italic>Madama Butterfly</span>. Then it's Lucia from <span style=font-style:italic>Lucia di Lammermoor</span>. As more characters travel through the magical glory hole, the orgy heats up, and Bess learns about the trap of being a trope. Together with her new sisterhood, she takes a journey to radical self-love through a whirlwind of arias and numbers from <span style=font-style:italic>Madama Butterfly, Turandot, Norma, Lucia, Carmina Burana, Lohengrin, The Mikado, The Wiz, Rent,</span> and more!”

“<span style=font-style:italic>The Big Swim</span>, a chamber opera celebrating the Lunar New Year, returns for 3 performances at Asia Society Texas on February 20–22. The one-act children's opera is a contemporary retelling of a Chinese fable that explains how the order of the 12 animals in the zodiac calendar was determined by a race across a river held by the Jade Emperor. In this telling by composer Meilina Tsui and librettist Melisa Tien, the audience is the Emperor and the race does not go exactly how the animals expect it to.”

<p>
“Laughter meets revolutionary spirit in BLO’s staging of Donizetti’s glorious comedy. Inspired by the life of Deborah Sampson, the Massachusetts revolutionary who disguised herself as a man to fight for independence, this production transports us to Revolutionary-era Boston, telling a heartfelt tale of love and loyalty to celebrate America’s 250th anniversary. With a new English dialogue by Kirsten Greenidge, it’s a patriotic toast to America at 250—and to the rebels who shaped it.”

This concert explores night’s place in our lives: a time for sharing stories, singing songs, confronting fears, and encountering both the divine and the terrible. Expect diverse music—beautiful, folk, strange, and lovely—movement through the space, and a communal sing-along around the fire. Come keep warm around the fire with us on the longest night of the year. This project is produced by Nicholas Ford.”
